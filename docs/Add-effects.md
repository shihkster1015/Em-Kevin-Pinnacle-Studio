# Task Three: Add Effects

Pinnacle Studio provides a suite of customizable built in effects. Adding effects to your video 
will prevent awkward transitions between video clips and also enhance dull looking video clips.

This section will go over the basics of adding, editing, and deleting video transitions and video effects.

![note](images/warning.png) **Note:** If the effect is an entrance effect, it will apply to the beginning of the video. If 
it is an exit effect, it will apply to the end of the video. If the effect is generic, you can choose to apply
it to the first half or second half by dropping the effect on the respective half. 

<br></br>
4\. Check that the effect was applied by looking for a box shape at the corner of your video clip. The first (green) half decreasing while the 
second (blue) half increasing means the effect will transition from the first video to the second. \

it on the clip that will be cut a bit short to include the transition.

5\. Edit the duration of the effect by **right-clicking** the effect box and selecting [Transition] > [Edit]. Enter
The duration of the effect and click [OK] to confirm and return.
