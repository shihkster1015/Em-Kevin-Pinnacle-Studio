3\. Drag and drop the effect on top of the video clip in the timeline.

![note](images/warning.png) note: If the effect is an entrance effect, it will apply to the beginning of the video. If \
it is an exit effect, it will apply to the end of the video. If the effect is generic, you can choose to apply
it to the first half or second half by dropping the effect on the respective half.
