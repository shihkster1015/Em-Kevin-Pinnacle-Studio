# Task Two: Adding Subtitles to Your Video

{: .no_toc .text-delta }

Adding subtitles to your video can help you deliver a clearer message to your audience.

This section will show you how to add subtitles to your existing videos and how to edit elements of the subtitle.

## Create Subtitle 

1\. Drag your video clip from your library to one of the available A/V channels. Except for the first channel.

_**Caution**: Leave the first track for subtitles. Tracks in Pinnacle Studio are like a stack of
 plates. The first track will be "on top" of tracks beneath it._
 
2\. Click Create Title denoted by the T symbol at the top of the timeline bar. A Title Editor window will pop up.

3\. Add your text under **Your Text Here**. Position your text to a suitable position on screen 
within the white outer box.

5\. Adjust the duration of the text by inputting when the subtitle will enter and when the subtitle will exit.
[] represents the beginning time. TC is the ending time.

6\. Click [OK] to save your text and exit out of the Title Editor.
