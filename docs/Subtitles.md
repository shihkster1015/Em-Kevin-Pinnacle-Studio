# Task Two: Adding Subtitles to Your Video

Adding subtitles to your video can help you deliver a clearer message to your audience. Pinnacle Studio supports
user customizable fonts and subtitle timing. You are able to customize how the fonts look and even animate the subtitles. 

This section will show you how to add subtitles to your existing videos, edit elements of the subtitle, and set the timing
for your subtitle.
