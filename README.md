# Collaboration
In the beginning, when we realized we wanted to do a guide for Pinnacle Studio, we each brainstormed a couple ideas. 
After consolidating the ideas, we chose the ones that interested us the most and we started to list the most important 
information that will help us write an informative user guide.


# How this guide was created
We explored a few new programs and concepts to help us create this user guide.  

## Slack
Due to COVID-19, we relied on Slack for all communications. 

## Markdown
Neither of us had experience with markdown. While our focus was to write a useful user guide, we did spend significant 
time learning the in and outs of markdown. 

Despite not knowing how to create a guide using markdown, it  still felt familiar. Both of us have seen markdown in use 
before as it is the universal method for creating guides for developers. 

With markdown, we learned how to create parent-child relationships, auto table of content generating headings, 
ordered and unordered lists, and links to anchors within our user guide scope.

## WebStorm
Webstorm was a new software for us and very effective. Instead of making edits directly on github or choosing a basic 
editing software, we were able to see an instant preview of what our guide will look like within WebStorm.  

Being able to see an instant preview allowed us to work efficiently and stay organized. We felt confident in the work we 
were committing to github and we could avoid using out git commits as the only means to check our code. 

## Theme
We chose to use themes from Jekyll for its simplicity and clean approach towards user guides. 

We forked Jekyll's Just the Docs theme and made changes to the _config.yml file and to the our copy of the repository.  

## Conventions

In order to keep our user guide simple and easy to follow, we created a few universal guidelines to follow.
Each instruction sentence can only contain one instruction. The shortened instructions will help the user follow along
without feeling overwhelmed with instructions. 

Annotations will have the following styles:
<ul>
<li>Box with rounded edges</li>
<li>Boxes and lines will have border outline weight 4.5</li>
<li>All annotations will be red</li>
</ul>

We also had two icons to get the reader's attention so they will follow the instructions carefully.

The following icon is a helpful tip that will help the user complete their goal. \

The following icon asks the user to pay extra attention to the current task. \

# Conclusion
Pinnacle Studio is a versatile software for creating professional videos. Users of Pinnacle Studio can range from 
professional videographers to basic users who want to create a good looking home video.
